## Project Status
Project is already complete. Although I will be adding more features in the feature.


## Room for Improvement
We could add a backend to the current system, there can also be a place where you can choose to either be a seller or a buyer and the seller could have the ability to add items

Room for improvement:
- CSS could be improved in some parts like the sign in page. 
- Shopping basket could be improved to look more like Amazon.

To do:
- Backend system with MongoDB.
- Seller accounts with the ability to add items.
